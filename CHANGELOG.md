# AIA r20-Release
### Changed
* AIA will prevent opening the options in combat from the Blizzard interface panel in an attempt to avoid UI taint due to 8.2 changes.
* AIA can now check the entire upcoming year, rather than just the next 30 days.
* AIA will delay checking when you initiate a manual check while the calendar frame is open and start the check after you close the calendar window.
