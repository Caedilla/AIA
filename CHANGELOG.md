# AIA r7-Release

### Changed
* AIA default profiles are now per-character rather than account wide.

### Fixed
* AIA should now properly check the date of an event and ignore past events.
* AIA should no longer get stuck if tentative and sign up as tentative are selected
* AIA should no longer skip over other actionable events that occur on the same day as an event that AIA has ignored.
