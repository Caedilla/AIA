# AIA r4-Release

### New
* Added option to sign up to available events.
    * If a guild event has been created for example, rather than an event you have been explicitly invited to, you can use this option automatically sign up to these events.
    * This option also has its own filtering options to only sign up to events created by specific players or with a specific title.
* You can now add multiple Names or Titles by separating them with a comma.
### Fixed
* /aia check should no longer open the configuration panel as well as running the check again.
* AIA should more reliably find events when you first login now.
