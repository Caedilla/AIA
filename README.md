## About

**AIA** is a simple addon to automatically accept in-game calendar invites. If your guild uses the in-game calendar for events, but you want to automatically reply that you'll be there. This is for you - especially if your guild creates events for every raid etc.

 

By default, AIA will ignore events where you have manually set them to tentative or declined. Using AIA, you don't have to worry about if you're signed up for an event, and if you can't attend - simply set yourself as such!

 
## Options

AIA comes with a few options which can be accessed from the Blizzard Interface window, on the AddOns tab, or by typing **/aia**.

* **Disable After Running** - This will shut down AIA after it has run once upon logging in. This means you don't need to worry about it using resources in the background. However, it also means if a new event is added while you are playing, AIA won't detect it until you enable AIA again, or you relog.
* **Notify when finished** - AIA will tell you how many events it has accepted you for when it has finishd its check.
* **Notify when disabled** - AIA will tell you when the addon disables itself after running.
* **Declined** - If selected, AIA will also set any events you have declined to accepted. Obviously this is disabled by default.
* **Tentative** - Same as Declined, but for Tentative status.
* **Invited** - This is the default status when you get invited to an event. If you want AIA to automatically accept any new events, leave this enabled.
* **Only Accept Invites From** - Here you can write a player name (e.g your guild master / raid leader), and if the calendar invite is not from that player, AIA will ignore it.
* **Only Accept invites with title** - If the name of the event doesn't match this, AIA will ignore it.
* **Only Accept invites of these types** - Allows you to filter invites by content type. If your guild lists meetings in the calendar as well as raids, you can choose if AIA will accept these types of events too.
* **Check Again** - If you have changed settings and think AIA might catch some other events to accept you for, you can click this, and AIA will check again. You can also type /aia check to run this same command.
